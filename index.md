# Hello There

<!--BIO-->
My name is `Asthi Seta`. I’m `17 years old`. My house is in `East Java, Indonesia`, 

I'm a `student at Telkom Malang Vocational High School`, I don’t smoke. I’m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning.

I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I’m trying to explain that `I’m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life`. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and `I know that is what brings me happiness`. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn’t lose to anyone.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/AkuraDiary/AkuraDiary.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AkuraDiary/AkuraDiary.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
